        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Google Trends gives us an estimate of search volume. Let's explore if
          search popularity relates to other kinds of data. Perhaps there are
          patterns in Google's search volume and the price of Bitcoin or a hot
          stock like Tesla. Perhaps search volume for the term "Unemployment
          Benefits" can tell us something about the actual unemployment rate?

        <h2>Data Manipulation</h2>
        <p>
          To begin, we will read in the dataset from a .csv file into a Pandas
          dataframe. We will then inspect the first and last few rows of the
          data to get a sense of its structure and content. Next, we will
          examine the dimensions of the dataframe, including the number of rows
          and columns, and count the number of entries in each column. We will
          also examine the shape of the dataframes. Finally, we will reformat
          the date column to make it more readable.

        <h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price v.s. Search Volume</h2>
        <p>
          Using Pandas <code>.resample()</code>, BTC price daily series is
          converted to monthly frequency and is comparable to BTC search monthly
          series. After matching the time series, plot BTC Price v.s. Search
          Volume.

        <p>
          The spike in Bitcoin price in 2017, reaching an all-time high of
          nearly $20,000, was accompanied by a surge in Google search interest,
          indicating a strong correlation between market enthusiasm and
          mainstream attention. The subsequent crash in 2018, where the price
          dropped by over 70%, was similarly mirrored by a decline in search
          interest, highlighting the volatile and speculative nature of the
          cryptocurrency market.

          Unemployement Benefits Search vs. Actual Unemployment in the U.S.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Unemployment claims in the US tend to spike during the winter months
          (December to February) and decline during the summer months (June to
          August), with a noticeable peak in initial jobless claims around
          January. This seasonal pattern is largely driven by industries such as
          construction, tourism, and education, which experience fluctuations in
          employment due to weather and academic cycles.

        <h2>Smoothing out Time Series Data</h2>
        <p>
          Historical data suggests that search trends for unemployment benefits
          often precede official changes in the unemployment rate. This is
          because individuals who are experiencing job loss or uncertainty tend
          to search for information on unemployment benefits before the official
          statistics are released. In fact, research has shown that Google
          search data can be used as a leading indicator of unemployment claims,
          with search volume often increasing before official unemployment rates
          rise. This is because search data can capture real-time sentiment and
          concerns of individuals, providing an early warning signal of labor
          market stress.

        <h2>Smoothing out Time Series Data</h2>
        <p>
          Unemployment claims in the US skyrocketed in March 2020, reaching a
          record high of 6.9 million initial claims, as the COVID-19 pandemic
          led to widespread lockdowns, business closures, and unprecedented job
          losses across various industries. This spike was largely driven by the
          sudden and drastic measures taken to contain the pandemic, which
          resulted in a sharp contraction in economic activity and a massive
          displacement of workers. Notably, while Google searches for
          unemployment benefits often precede official rate increases, the 2008
          economic crisis saw a sharp jump in the official unemployment rate to
          10% in a short time, exceeding any increase in Google searches. This
          highlights the severity of the crisis and the limits of using search
          data as a leading indicator.
